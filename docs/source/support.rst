Support and Development
=======================

For questions directly related to *hubspot-contacts*, please use our
`2degrees-floss mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/2degrees-floss/>`_.

The aim of this project is not to support 100% of the HubSpot APIs related to
contacts. We'll only implement the functionality that we need, but if there's
anything you're missing, we'd be pleased to apply patches as long as:

- They are `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and preferably
  `257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ compliant.
- They come fully unit-tested.
- They don't break existing functionality.

Please go to `our development site on GitHub
<https://github.com/2degrees/hubspot-contacts/>`_ to get the 
latest code, create pull requests and raise `issues
<https://github.com/2degrees/hubspot-contacts/issues/>`_.
